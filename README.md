# Python
This Repository will hold all of pyhton codes that i created during my academic projects

## 1 - flow shop scheduling
### Definition 
There are n machines and m jobs. Each job contains exactly m operations. The i-th operation ofthe job must be executed on the i-th machine. No machine can perform more than one operation simultaneously.For each operation of each job, execution time is specified.
Operations within one job must be performed in the specified order. The first operation gets executed on the first machine, then (as the first operation is finished) the second operation on the second machine, and so on until the n-th operation. Jobs can be executed in any order, however. Problem definition implies that this job order is exactly the same for each machine. The problem is to determine the optimal such arrangement, i.e. the one with the shortest possible total job execution makespan.


For our project we choose n = 4 et m = 5
